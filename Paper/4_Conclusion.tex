This paper details several different transformation methods for rotation in three dimensions.
Euler angles, rotation matrices, and quaternions were all described, and compared, and the conversions between them were presented.
Overall, quaternions offer better usability for almost every application, except in applications were translations are also needed.
Quaternions have uses in aeronautics, robotics, and computer graphics.
They prevent gimbal lock, a phenomenon whereby three degrees of freedom becomes two degrees of freedom.
Quaternions are also used for spherical interpolation, also known as \textit{slerp}.
MATLAB code was used to investigate quaternions and slerp.
